Bucardo - a table-based replication system

DESCRIPTION:
------------

This repository is a fork of version 5.6.0 of Bucardo. I'll be trying out tests and configuring few scenarios to set up trigger based replication between two PostgreSQL clusters, using Bucardo.

POSSIBLE ARCHITECTURE:
----------------------

Below are the list of possible architecture, to deploy Bucardo between two DB instances:

1. **Bucardo on Server 1**: This idea involves performing Bucardo Replication between two host machines, where Bucardo resides in the same node as DB Server 1.

2. **Bucardo on Server 2**: This idea involves performing Bucardo Replication between two host machines, where Bucardo resides in the same node as DB Server 2.

3. **Bucardo on Middleware**: This idea involves performing Bucardo Replication between two host machines, where Bucardo resides in a separate node, between the two DB instances.

TEST SCENARIO:
--------------

For our testing purposes, we'll be deploying Bucardo using Architecture 3 i.e. `Bucardo on a Middleware`. This should give us some extra information.

Also, we'll be configuring multi-master replication for this.
